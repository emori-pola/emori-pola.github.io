              It is difficult to fully understand English if it is the language
              of choice (content is too difficult, speed is too fast, etc.)
              because it does not support one's native language.

        Gabriel is a junior in college. He is studying abroad in Europe. He is
        interested in art and often goes to museums. He frequently uses audio
        guides. Although English is not his native language and he understands
        it reasonably well, he chooses English when there is no native language
        in the audio guide, but it is difficult for him to understand it
        completely because the speed is too fast and there are words he does not
        know.
